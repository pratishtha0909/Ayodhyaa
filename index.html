<h2><b>1. RAM MANDIR</b></h2>
<p>The Ram Mandir is a partially constructed Hindu temple complex in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India.

The temple was inaugurated[7] on 22 January 2024 after a prana pratishtha (consecration) ceremony. On the first day of its opening, following the consecration, the temple received a rush of over half a million visitors, and after a month, the average number of visitors was reported to be "1 to 1.5 lakh (100,000 to 150,000) on a daily basis". <img style="width:40%;" src="file:///C:/Users/PRANJAL/Desktop/wp8237488.jpg">

<h2><b>3. SURAJKUND </b> </h2>
<p> Suraj Kund is a big tank surrounded by ghats that presents an exclusively beautiful sight to visitors. The Suryavanshi rulers of Ayodhya, it is believed, constructed the kund to pay obeisance to the Sun god.


In ancient times this place was also called Ghoshark Tirtha. It is believed that in ancient times a king named Ghosh once saw the sages and sages taking a bath in the pool while passing through here. After this, he also took a bath in the pool. The body of the king became divine after bathing.Knowing the glory of the place from the sages, he worshiped Lord Bhaskar. It is believed that Suryadev also gave him darshan and his sharp image produced him. King Ghosh installed the statue. <br>
